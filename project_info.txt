1.all_gene_disease_pmid_associations
	:this file have 2 purposes
	1.this file is used to create anyfile that directly require value to be extracted directly from disease_gene.tsb
	2.this file is used to create file with specific label such as disease label

	>it generates the following files 
		such as generated_dataset/gene_disease_uniq.txt
			generated_dataset/copd_label.txt
			
2.copd_terminology_extract.py
	>this file requires class of diseaseId to be manually put in
	>it generates mappings from cuis to doid of selected label that have mapping in disease_gene.tsv.

3. map_umls.py
	>This file used to generated mapping files such as the following
		:disease_mppings_umls/gene_disease_uniq_DO_mapping.txt
	>This file also contains some outdated code thats does the bottom up labeling by collecting parent of all diseaseId recursively until there exist only few number of parents classes, after that we pick the top n-th class as labels
	>list of the outdated files are as followed
		:gene_disease_#_DO_mapping.txt 
		:parent_diseaseId_uniq_DO_mapping.txt
		:parent_parent_diseaseId_uniq_DO_mapping.txt
		:parent_parent_valid_diseaseId_uniq_DO.txt
			>valid indicate that doid has mapping to cuis
	>This file also contains label from the top down approach 
		>>code that use top down approach is not yet implemented, because in this case, we only use copd related disease and copd_comorbidity disease just happend to not have the same label as these top down classes
