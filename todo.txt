    >>make node size proportion to its degree.

> figure out what subplot do?
    >> we must modify plot_networkx(bipartite = True) to have bipartite layer?
    >> change plot_networkx(bipartite = True) so that it dose the following
            1.  top subplot = graph label by col_name
                bottom subplot = bipartite graph label by group members


> create function that draw bipartite without creating subplot graph.
    >> plot_subplot vs plot_bipartite
    >> create new parameter to draw subplot vs not drwing subplot
>community detection = Flase + bipartite = True
    >> does not show bipartite subplot, it only show grpah with nodes labels by columns names

        Is there a place to upload file to UniProtKB -> GeneOntology

#####FIX PLOTTING
> in bipartite = True, there should be 2 options.
    1. use community detection and plot color of nodes in each community
    2. plot graph where gene has 1 color and disease has another color

> fix subplot method so that it shows legend's and color its member's node.
    >>fix: mismatch of number of color_ist and nodes in G
        line: 497 in plotGraph_with_legend()


> In all_gene_disease_pmid_association.py ( I should run this at fau)
    >>use gene_disease_uniq_DO_mapping to create /generated/all_gene_disease_pmid_no_None.txt
    >> after than, use map_umls.py to create /demo/all_gene_disease_pmid.txt



## spring 2019 final project tasks (check if I have finished all of them)
1. List of copd related diseas and genes extracted (disease names, genee names, also number of members in each category)
2. Show the copd related gene neworks, disae networks, and gene-disease networks (including network characteristics, such as degree distributions)
3. Find a community of (gene-disease), report who are the genes and diseases in these communities.
